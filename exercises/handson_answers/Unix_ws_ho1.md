~~~{bash}
# option 1 - write down the numbers inside the text editor
nano f1.txt

# option 2 - print and redirect the output (not very recommended as it is error prone)

~~~

# option 1 - write down the seq inside the text editor
nano .f2.txt

# option 2 - print them and redirect the output (not very recommended as it is error prone)
echo -e "a\na\nb\nb\nb\nc\nc\nc\nc\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\n" > >.f2.txt

head -10 f1.txt | cat f2.txt > f3.txt
```

10. Change the permissions of f1.txt so that only the user can read and write the file
```{}
# Multiple ways to do this one!
# one option - rewrite all of the permissions
chmod u+rw,go-rw f1.txt
# or
chmod 700 f1.txt

# another option - just remove the ones that are not useful
chmod go-rwx f1.txt
```

11. Count the number of lines in file f3.txt
```{}
wc -l f3.txt
